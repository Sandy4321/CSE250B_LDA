# Project 3: latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)

## Goals
Use LDA models with the Gibbs sampling training algorithm to classify documents use a set list of classes (e.g. sports, politics).


## Datasets

### classic400.mat
The 2D array 'classic400' contains the number of times each word is found in each document (rows=document, columns=word in vocalubary). Example: classic400(1,1) is the count of word 1 in document 1, classic400(100,500) is the count of word 500 in document 100, etc.
